    1. Better quality data and online management system
    Anyone who wants to ensure a safe workplace and regulatory compliance cannot avoid dealing with data. Documentation and
    data handling even with the best intention is a mess, that you’ll be glad to let a software deal with. With an online
    safety and compliance management system, timely access to data and taking action is straightforward.
    
    Data Capture: Online safety and compliance management tool provides standardised forms which make information gathering
    seamless and consistent. The forms are customizable to suit your goals or organisation while ensuring every data
    pertinent to achieving workplace safety and compliance is captured without fuss.
    
    Data handling: Visualization tools allow you to make sense of data captured at a glance. And, depending on your goals,
    you can “clean” and consolidate the information you gathered without additional help.
    
    Data Storage: Safety and compliance data need to be stored efficiently, securely and in a manner that allows for easy
    retrieval. An online safety and compliance management platform gives you all these benefits and more.
    
    Takeaway: Using an online safety and compliance system that allows you to manage workplace Safety, Health, and
    Compliance data for your company from a single source provides a trove of advantages which include: higher quality data,
    reduction in cost, avoidance of drudgery, saving time and eventually leading to better safety and compliance outcomes.
    
    2. Improves organisation, efficiency, and productivity
    Quick Reminder: To achieve a safe and compliant working environment, numerous tasks need completing appropriately and at
    the perfect time.
    
    At the top of the agenda is completing and implementing WHS policies and procedures, which guarantee the highest level
    of safety and meets the needs of the regulator.
    
    With an online platform, you can capture exactly what you need for your audit, as well as organise appointments and
    tasks easily. This way, a clash of tasks or cancelation of appointments because the employees involved are not available
    can be avoided.
    
    Furthermore, the cyclically recurring occupational health and safety tests require precise timing. An online safety
    system helps to smooth out the often bumpy coordination of the necessary work steps resulting in efficient completion of
    tasks
    
    In an ideal case, an organisation’s relevant WHS policies and procedures whether it deals with employees, a system, or a
    machine can be managed. For equipment, the legally prescribed maintenance, repairs, troubleshooting, or repairs becomes
    a child's play with the appropriate online safety and compliance management system. In addition, maintenance no longer
    has to be coordinated between several systems or tools which leave more rooms for errors often leading to mismatched
    business expectations or disappointing outcomes for the staff.
    
    3. Helps with meeting compliance requirements
    An online safety and compliance management system will ensure that your company complies with the Government, Industry
    bodies, and internal policies to help keep your business safe.
    
    Using an online compliance management system allows you to track changes as they happen. This is crucial in fulfilling
    legislation where a slight change in government regulations can be costly - hence the need for this tool that helps you
    remain vigilant and allows you to respond to compliance changes swiftly. They do this by alerting you to pending changes
    and facilitating planning and implementation.
    
    For instance: With any reliable online compliance management tool- you can plan, carry out and document tests of
    machines, systems, and equipment. So you have everything together to implement the requirements for managing
    occupational safety in your company easily and without problems.
    
    In the end, consider an online compliance management tool to be your trusted “compliance advisor.” And even if all
    compliance activities are not completed via automation, it will make sure it prompts you to do what is required at the
    right time.
    
    4. Save on time and money
    The goal of every business is to cut costs and achieve results faster. You get both of these by using a compliance/ WHS
    management system online.
    
    Because tasks are completed online, it immediately reduces overhead cost - as less paperwork has to be carried out. For
    example, activities like printing are reduced, so you save paper and electricity. Additionally, forms and reports are
    digital and easily transferable. This saves processing time and cost.
    
    By automating safety and compliance management processes, part of the available workforce can be released for other
    tasks. Furthermore, the number of employees can even be reduced.
    
    5. Improved employee safety and welfare
    It's important that your staff are safe when they are at work. Ensuring this can be complex because every employee has
    different needs. By taking an online approach to safety and compliance management, you can measure their knowledge on
    safety-related issues and access their level of compliance on an individual basis. This way those in need can be
    attended to - for example, where a knowledge gap is noticed, training can be organised to shore up their skills.
    Additionally, safety risks are quick and easy to identify using online tools that prompt intervention through the
    implementation of mitigating measures to limit risk.
    
    6. Minimises error and promotes consistency
    Imagine all the work associated with health and safety record keeping - it’s a lot of paperwork, and it can result in a
    huge setback when staff members don’t do it correctly.
    
    Achieving optimal compliance and safety in a workplace requires a great deal of data collection and information
    handling. As you can guess, manual methods are not only tedious but are prone to human errors.
    
    This is one aspect for which online safety and compliance management systems are created; to solve this problem - and
    significantly reduce errors.
    
    No matter how experienced and diligent your employees are, they are humans who are likely to make mistakes. If certain
    processes are automated using an online safety/compliance management system, errors can be limited, making the entire
    process more consistent and error-free.
    
    ‍7. Effortless Reporting and Tracking
    Having an online safety and compliance management system is all about providing a good experience for everyone involved.
    
    You should feel secure and confident that your business is committed to safety and compliance, and your employees should
    be committed every step of the way to achieving that. For this reason, online tracking and reporting have become a
    crucial part of online safety and compliance management systems.

    Easily course correct or initiate/contribute to corrective actions on the fly from within the system.
    Why is it a big deal?
    
    You don’t need multiple systems. Rather, accomplish all your report-related tasks smoothly and continuously, with no
    apparent stops.
    
    8. Improves Brand image
    A good image gives your company a competitive edge: You can find investors more easily, attract good employees and look
    forward to loyal customers who will remain loyal to you in the long term.
    
    Having an online system that manages your company's safety and regulatory compliance, reflects as an investment that you
    are willing to make for the safety of your business and your staff.

    significance which would ultimately reflect in an improved bottom line.
    
    9. Reduced downtime and lost business
    As a busy manager, it’s hard to stay on top of employee safety. But if you don’t do it, you could end up in court.
    
    Unlike the traditional option, using online health, safety, and compliance management systems means you are not limited
    by location and time thus giving you enough wiggle room and “extra hours” to work towards minimising risk and
    compliance.

    decentralized team cutting across time zones possible.
